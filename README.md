# processingPhysics

This is a collection of simple programs that I wrote when I first started learning processing. They are proof-of-concepts written in processing to measure physical attrubutes of a simple object in a simple physics system.

## Bounce.pde
This shows a bouncing object

## Follow.pde
This shows an object that follows the mouse, albeit without any momentum

## Orbit.pde
This is a more advanced version (as it has momentum) of follow.pde where the object orbits the mouse
